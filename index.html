            in the independent state of Kazakhstan, in the city named Pavlodar. <br>
            My name was given to me by my sister.Father went to Valhalla when I was 4 years old. <br>
            All my life I lived on my land, and in 1442, after the birth of the Prophet Muhammad, <br>
            I left my home to start a new life, the life of a Viking, so that after centuries <br>
            my name would be remembered, like that of Ragnar Lothbrok. </font>

                  <h2>Secondary school â„–25 </h2>
                  <h3>September,2009 - June,2020 </h3>

                  Just like every school in Kazakhstan, my school gave me basic knowledge in different directions <br>
                  like: mathematic, physic, chemistry, biology, kazakh & russian & english languages, ict.<br>
                  In 10-11th started preparing for Unified national test, and I chose Physical and Mathematical <br>
                  directions. At the same time I discovered my skills in programming and made my first website,<br>
                  thereby winning regional Olympiads <br> <br>

                  <h2>Astana IT University</h2>
                  <h3>September,2020 - till now</h3>
                  For whole my life, I am connected with computers. Starting from 2 years I use computer in <br>
                  different directions, but not programming. Only in 11th grade, I had to make a website for Olympiads<br>
                  and I loved it. Then I set myself the goal of entering Astana IT at any cost so I did it. <br>
                  My professional is "Software Engineering", and I hope,that this University will make me a cool programmer<br><br>

                  <h2>Guitar</h2>
                  In 2017, I went to a sanatorium in Almaty, and there I met a musician who inspired me to <br>
                  start learning to play the piano. When I came home, I tried to learn the piano,<br>
                  but I realized that it was not mine, but just as quickly I realized that the guitar is my recognition,<br>
                  and since that time I have been playing the guitar. <br><br>

                  <h2>Exploring the Universe </h2>
                  In 2019 I decided to choose physic in Unified national test, and this became my hobby. <br>
                  I am very curious about our Universe, our reality, gravitation, dark matter, speed of light and etc. <br>
                  Physic is a very interesting subject, but unfortunately in our schools teachers cannot interest us. <br>
                  Also I love to make my own theorems about a creation of the Universe, maybe soon I will post it here. <br><br>

                  <h2>Programming</h2>
                  Not considering my first experience in Web Development in 11th grade, I have never had any skills or <br>
                  experience in programming. All of it I got in the Astana IT University. Just like: Programming in C++ language, <br>
                  creating Databases, Web Development, programminig in Java language, more and more I will be tought in the future <br>
